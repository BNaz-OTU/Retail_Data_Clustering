<p>
Leveraging data science methodologies and principles, analyzed customer retail data to uncover insights into shopping behavior patterns. Utilizing the Scikit-learn and Pandas libraries, implemented a K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups. This analysis enabled a deeper understanding of key customer segments, providing actionable insights that can guide the retail store in optimizing strategies for customer loyalty, retention, and acquisition.

Using various data science techiques, data was cleaned and processed through the identification and imputation of missing values, normalization of variables, and treatment of outliers, ensuring the preparation of high-quality data for generating precise and reliable reports.

Leveraged the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to integrate a diverse set of visualizations, demonstrating advanced capabilities including 2D and 3D plots. Additionally, utilized box plots, violin plots, and scatter plots to effectively highlight key metrics, enhancing data interpretation and providing deeper insights for improved decision-making.
